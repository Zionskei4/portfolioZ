This setup ensures a seamless workflow between:

v0.dev (building & editing)

GitHub (version control)

Vercel (deployment)

🔄 Automatic Sync Workflow

Here’s how your system works end-to-end:

Build or update your project using v0.dev

Deploy changes through the v0 interface

v0 automatically pushes the latest code to this GitHub repository

Vercel detects updates and redeploys the newest version instantly

This creates a zero-maintenance CI/CD pipeline with no extra setup required.

📄 Important Notes

Avoid manually editing automatically generated files unless you're familiar with the structure.

For UI improvements or structural changes, it’s best to use the v0.dev editor.

GitHub + Vercel will handle all syncing and deployment automatically.
